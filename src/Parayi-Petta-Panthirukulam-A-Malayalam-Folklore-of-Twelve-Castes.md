The story goes that Vararuchi was cursed by his guru to marry a Pariah woman and wander around the world. He met Panchami, a beautiful Pariah woman who was also cursed by a sage to become a Pariah after she unknowingly served him beef. They fell in love and got married. Panchami became pregnant twelve times and each time she gave birth, Vararuchi asked her if the child had a mouth. When she said yes, he told her to abandon the child in the forest, as he believed that God would provide for anyone who had a mouth. Panchami obeyed him every time, except for the last child, whom she hid under her armpit. Vararuchi then asked her if she had any unfulfilled wishes. She said that she wanted to see all her children. Vararuchi agreed and they set out to find them.
 
They discovered that each of their children had survived and grown up to become prominent members of different castes and professions. The first child was Mezhathol Agnihothri, a Namboothiri Brahmin and a renowned Vedic scholar. The second child was Pakkanar, a Pariah who made earthen pots and cremated the dead. The third child was Naranath Bhranthan, a madman who rolled big stones up hills and laughed when they fell down. The fourth child was Vayillakunnilappan, a temple priest who ate a lot. The fifth child was Perumthachan, a carpenter and an architect who built temples and palaces. The sixth child was Uppukottan, a salt merchant and a philanthropist. The seventh child was Akavoor Chathan, a physician and a minister. The eighth child was Karakkal Amma, the only daughter who became a poetess and a dancer. The ninth child was Uliyannoor Perumthachan, another carpenter and an architect who was the rival of his elder brother. The tenth child was Vallon, a brave warrior and a leader of the Ezhava caste. The eleventh child was Vethakorumakan, an astrologer and a magician. The twelfth child was Pananar, a musician and a singer.
 
Vararuchi and Panchami were overjoyed to see their children and blessed them. They then proceeded to Ochira, where they installed an idol of Para Brahma, the supreme God who has no form or attributes. They spent their last days in worship and attained salvation.
 
Parayi Petta Panthirukulam is a fascinating folktale that reflects the social and cultural diversity of Kerala. It also shows the importance of tolerance, compassion, and destiny in human life. The folktale has been retold in various forms of literature, art, and media over the years.
